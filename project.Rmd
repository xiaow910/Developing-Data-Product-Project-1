#Introduction
This project was created as part of the Developing Data Products course project. 
The goal of the project was to create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet, 
and to host the resulting web page on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.
For each icon the link is provided so that clicking on it redirects to the restaurant yelp pages.
Map shows few selected restaurant, out of many more.

#Data Sources
The longitude and lantitude data was taken from Google Maps and Latitude Wesbsite

# Featured Restaurants in Atlanta,GA
